    }
}

Notes:
- Each document represents a complete calibration certificate.
- Measurements are grouped by type (e.g., "Humedad Relativa", "Temperatura - Medici√≥n").
- Numeric values are stored as strings.
- There are 169 certificates in total in the database.
- Fields like TUR, MeasUncert are important for precision.
- CustomerRequirements may contain specific client information.
- All certificates have IsAccredited set to true.

Your task is to generate a MongoDB aggregation pipeline query based on the user's question. Use the sample questions provided as guidance when necessary. Return only the MongoDB aggregation pipeline query as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional text or explanation.
